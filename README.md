# AutomaticAds CS2
This plugin allows you to schedule and display announcements in the chat at customizable intervals. Each announcement is accompanied by a brief sound effect to capture players' attention seamlessly.

> [!CAUTION]
> Ads with `"Screen"` have been re-enabled. However, the current solution does not work as well as it did before the 07/28/2025 update. It is recommended not to use this feature for now, pending a more stable method.
